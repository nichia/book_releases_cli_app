# BookReleasesCliApp

Welcome to the Book Releases CLI gem! This application will scrape barnesandnoble.com and booksamillion.com to provide you with a list of the upcoming book releases. 

Select the stores you want to view the upcoming book releases. A list view of the store's upcoming books will be displayed. You can get a detail view of a book by entering that book's number, otherwise repeat the search or exit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'book_releases_cli_app'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install book_releases_cli_app

## Usage

Execute the following command and follow the prompts.

    $ bin/book-releases

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
